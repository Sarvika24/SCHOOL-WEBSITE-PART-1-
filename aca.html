            <h1>ACADEMICS IN AMITY</h1>
            <h3>METHODOLOGY AND CURRICULUM</h3>
            <p>At AIS NOIDA, a variety of teaching-learning methodologies, integrated with technology, are used to give students a holistic education making them independent, life-long learners and above all responsible citizens of the globe. Equal attention is given to the development of the body, mind and spirit. Consequently, teachers provide students with the individual attention necessary to help them achieve their goals. Critical judgment is encouraged so that students can discuss topics with coherent arguments supported by evidence. Moreover, teachers know, motivate and understand their pupils and have a deep knowledge of the subject. Records of progress are shared periodically with parents. An extensive academic programme is planned and reviewed periodically ensuring that all classes achieve consistently high results. Classes are interactive and students learn in very stimulating and motivating ways.
            <h3>TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION</h3>
            <p>Smart classes convert an ordinary classroom into an interactive learning experience, using latest state of the art techniques like Smart Board and digital learning. We make use of the smart board in all the subjects. With the use of smart classes we allow our students to question, evaluate, create, communicate and discover.</p>
